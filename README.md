## advanced analysis using DAX  

## Introduction
As getting into data as a job seeker, I always have a doubt what are the most demanding skills to get into data job and what skills do employers adore and willing to pay more. In this project I did analyze the top skills and what kind of roles do we get into with those particular skills.

## Questions that I answer with my analysis

### To get to know more about data jobs, I analysed the following:

  1. Does more skills equals to better pay?
  2. What's the salary for data jobs in different regions?
  3. What are the top skills required for a data job?
  4. What is the pay for the top 10 skills?

## Skills that I used for this project

  1. Pivot Tables
  2. Pivot Charts
  3. DAX: Data analysis expressions
  4. Power query
  5. Power Pivot

  1. Job titles
  2. salaries
